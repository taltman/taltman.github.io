I use [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/) for easy encrypted
messaging. Email me if you want to set that up.

I can share with you my [GPG key](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/) information for
sending me encrypted messages upon request.

Please do not send me sensitive information (e.g., passwords, personal
details, financial/health information) via email, as it is not secure.
Please contact me to determine the best way to transfer sensitive
information safely. Thank you!
