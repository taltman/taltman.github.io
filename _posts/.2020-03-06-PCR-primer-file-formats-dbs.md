title: "An informal review of PCR file formats and databases"
---

I'm currently looking into creating a resource for organizing all of
the information on [COVID-19 primer
designs](2020-03-03-technical-problems-COVID-primers.md), to aid in
bringing order to the ensuing chaos now that the FDA has allowed for
states and other qualified agencies to develop their own tests. Part
of this research is to figure out if there are existing data formats
and standards for representing primer-probe sets. I'm capturing my
knowledge here as I do the research.

## Primer Databases

A first sensible place to look would be to see if there are existing
players in this space. If someone has been maintaining a database,
then they would likely have already done some deep thinking about
knowledge representation. Here is what I have come across so far:

* [PrimerBank](https://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/)
  Exclusively human and mouse genomes.

* [RTPrimerDB](http://www.rtprimerdb.org/index.php)
  Free registry for validated RTPCR primers. Focus seems to be on
  mammalian model organisms. Last "News" from the site was from 2006.

* [qPrimerDB](https://biodb.swu.edu.cn/qprimerdb/)
  Last updated copyright notice from 2018. Focus on eukaryota.

* [BOLD Systems](http://www.boldsystems.org)
  Seems like a well-funded Canadian effort. Doesn't support prokaryota
  nor viruses.

* [MRPrimerV](mrprimerv.com)
  A database for validated RNA virus primer sets. Seems very relevant
  in terms of focus. Last updated in 2016. 

So in summary there are
